     <p class="p">The Social Cyborg initiative was made in order to embrace the rise of technology and to connect individuals with their digital selves too join the two beings. Past generations often had the opinion our generation and those after us had become Antisocial unable to communicate thoughts and feelings with each other.  little do they know we have never been more social connecting with thousands of people in an instant, discovering news ways of life, cultures and building a greater understanding of our world rather than living in our own little bubble. Thanks to technology we have become more efficient and knowledgeable humans. It is now time we acknowledge the next step in our evolution.  Our future is technology, cybernetics and augmentation and together the perfect human will be constructed. A Social Cyborg. </p>
